# ðŸ“˜ Phase 1: C#/.NET Advanced Reinforcement Plan

This learning plan is designed to reinforce existing knowledge and fill identified conceptual and practical gaps in .NET and C#.  
The plan is organized into 3 focus areas: **Async & Memory Performance**, **Architectural Patterns**, and **Domain-Driven Design**.

---

## ðŸ”· Focus Area 1: Async Programming & Memory Performance

**Goal:** Improve understanding and application of async programming internals and high-performance memory handling.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts to Learn
- `Span<T>` and `Memory<T>` for stack-allocated, non-allocating operations
- `ValueTask` and how it compares to `Task`
- `CancellationTokenSource` and advanced token usage
- `Lazy<T>` for deferred initialization
- `ConfigureAwait(false)` and sync context behavior

### âœ… Hands-On Tasks
- [x] Write a method that parses and transforms a byte array using `Span<byte>` with no allocations
- [ ] Create a cancellable async method using `CancellationToken` and `CancellationTokenSource`
- [ ] Refactor an async method to avoid context capture using `ConfigureAwait(false)`
- [ ] Use `Lazy<T>` to defer initialization of an expensive resource
- [ ] Explore scenarios where `ValueTask` offers performance benefits

## ðŸŸ¡ Focus Area 2: Architectural Patterns & Clean Design

**Goal:** Formalize knowledge of common patterns and improve system modularity and testability.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts to Learn
- Repository Pattern (for separation of persistence)
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- MediatR (simplified in-process messaging)
- SOLID principles (focus on Open/Closed, SRP)
- Clean Architecture layering

### âœ… Hands-On Tasks
- [ ] Build a small ASP.NET Core app using MediatR and CQRS
- [ ] Implement an `IRepository<T>` abstraction and swap in-memory vs database implementations
- [ ] Apply Open/Closed Principle to a class that uses a strategy pattern
- [ ] Write unit tests for a command handler using MediatR + mocking dependencies

## ðŸ”¶ Focus Area 3: Domain-Driven Design & System Thinking

**Goal:** Understand DDD principles and how they apply to scalable service boundaries and system modeling.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts to Learn
- Bounded Contexts and context mapping
- Aggregates and transactional consistency
- Value Objects vs Entities
- Domain Events
- CQRS in domain separation

### âœ… Hands-On Tasks
- [ ] Define a bounded context diagram for a domain you know (e.g., car wash, metrics tool)
- [ ] Implement value objects (e.g., `Email`, `Money`, `Coordinates`) in C#
- [ ] Use domain events and handlers in a modular service design
- [ ] Break an existing CRUD service into a CQRS-style pattern

## ðŸ“† Recommended Weekly Flow (Flexible)

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | Read 1â€“2 articles or docs from a single focus area |
| Tue | Code hands-on task (small 30â€“60 min prototype) |
| Wed | Review concept, reimplement from memory |
| Thu | Study cross-topic link (e.g., how async + DI work together) |
| Fri | Summarize key takeaways in a journal or blog |
| Weekend | Optional: Refactor something old using new concepts |

---

> ðŸ§­ **Track Progress:** Use checkboxes above. Aim for 4â€“6 weeks for Phase 1, then reassess strengths and shift to Phase 2 (e.g., observability, performance tuning, distributed systems).
